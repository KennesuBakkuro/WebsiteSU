        <!---->
        <b>Welcome to the world of LifeAfterDeath!</b><br />
        Now that the fist game is in development, let's talk about it! <br />
        The first game is probably a non cannon game as well as a demo to the
        series,
        <br />
        we are still not aware of how the story will progress, <br />
        but with the first game in development, <br />
        we will see if it has potential or not!
        <br />

        <br />
        <!---->
        <b>What is going to be the title of the first game!</b><br />
        the title for the first game will be called the
        <b>LifeAfterDeath TheVoid!</b><br />
        and again it really has a potential to be a dlc, but we will see...
      </p>

      <b>Who will be the characters for the first game?</b><br />
      a character from jamie named <b>10</b> will set an appearance at the
      end<br />
      but he won't appear much long, but the main character name is <b>LEO</b
      ><br />
      one of the monster caught LEO sister and now on his journey to save her<br />
      but while on the journey the dark truth reveals... <br />
      <br />

      <b>What is the game going to be about in the first game?</b><br />
      LEO is trapped in the void while her sister got captured by a monster<br />
      you must find a way out to the void at the same time save your sister...
      <br />
      <br />

      <b>Is the first game going to be scary?</b><br />
      Not only the first game going to be scary it also has disturbing images as
      well <br />
      im not sure if we will include it, but there is a chance we will include a
      4th wall break<br />
      LifeAfterDeath is not just going to be rebirth type of game, it's fcked up
      <br />
      the 4th wall break is going to be like... if you are familiar with irisu
      syndrome game <br />
      you can already get an idea on how the 4th wall will work! <br />
      <br />

      <!---->
      <b>How many monster will appears in the first game?</b><br />
      The monster for the first game is not much only 2 that's all<br />
      we can't really reveal much of the monsters...<br />
      <br />

      <!---->
      <b>Who is LEO sister?</b><br />
      Lou...
      <br />

      <!---->
      <b>Is there any release date for the first game?</b><br />
      game is still on development and we really <br />
      make sure that we won't rush the game, once the game is fully developed
      <br />
      we will release a release date as soon as possible so we can continue
      working<br />
      on the main series...
